Furthermore, ongoing technological advancements have led to the development of gloves that provide superior comfort, durability, and a lower risk of allergic reactions, expanding the market reach for examination gloves among healthcare professionals.</p> <h2>Surgical Gloves</h2> <p>Surgical gloves are specialized gloves designed for use during invasive medical procedures, such as surgeries, to maintain a sterile environment and prevent the risk of infections. These gloves are typically thicker and more durable than examination gloves, providing higher protection levels. They are available in a variety of sizes and typically come powdered or powder-free, depending on the preferences of the surgical team. Surgical gloves are subject to strict regulatory standards due to their critical role in ensuring patient safety during surgery. Latex surgical gloves are widely used, though non-latex variants like nitrile gloves are becoming increasingly popular, particularly for individuals with latex allergies. <p>The market for surgical gloves in the United States is influenced by factors such as the rising number of surgeries, both elective and non-elective, and the continued advancements in surgical techniques. Furthermore, the increasing focus on patient safety and infection prevention measures is driving the demand for high-quality surgical gloves. With growing concerns around surgical site infections and the introduction of enhanced gloves with antimicrobial properties, this segment of the market is expected to witness steady growth. The demand for surgical gloves is also anticipated to rise due to the aging population and the expansion of healthcare services.</p> <h2>Others</h2> <p>The "Others" segment of the disposable medical protective gloves market includes gloves used for various non-examination and non-surgical applications in the medical field.
